### What I learned

During the development of this project, I learned to:

* Implement a mobile-first approach to ensure the interface looks good on devices of all sizes.
* Combine Flexbox and CSS Grid to achieve a more dynamic design.
* Design the page in Figma, which helped me visualize and plan the layout effectively.

### Continued development

* Refining my skills in CSS Grid and Flexbox to create even more complex designs.
* Learning about CSS animations to enhance the user experience.
* Implementing accessibility tools to ensure my projects are inclusive.
